  <h2>Session 2 - 8/16</h2>
    <p>Previously, each of you received a cryptic letter summoning you to the local tavern. Upon arrival, you found the winery owner in a heated discussion with a pair of guards, and overheard troubling news. There had been strange occurrences at her winery, culminating in the mysterious disappearance of her husband. Desperate, she implored you to investigate the dark underbelly of her winery, where her workers had grown too fearful to venture.</p>    

    <p>Though strangers to one another, you agreed to take on the task and descended into the winery's shadowy basement. There, you were immediately beset by swarms of rats, both large and small. After enduring some wounds, you pressed further into the twisting cave system beneath the winery. Finding a relatively secure spot, you took a much-needed rest, taking turns on watch to guard against the unknown.</p>

    <p>Vella, you were last on watch, your senses keen and your eyes trained on the open cavern before you. A heavy fog clung to the edges of your vision, but throughout the night, nothing stirred. Now, you all wake, injuries healed, ready to face whatever lies ahead.</p>
